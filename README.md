Aeroelastic analysis of a turboprop aircraft's propeller and stability analysis for the Whirl Flutter aeroelastic phenomenon

Small Abstract : 

3D design of a real turboprop aicraft's propeller. CFD analysis (Aerodynamic
Forces, Pressure distribution etc.) and Simulation using ANSYS's Fluent.
Spectral analysis of Signals using Fourier transformation.
FSI analysis (stresses, strains,displacements, Pressure and Density distribution)
and Simulation using ANSYS's softwares. Created custom code in Matlab for
Parametric Stability Analysis using eigenvalue and Routh-Hurwitz methods
and propeller's trajectory calculation.
